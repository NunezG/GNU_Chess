compile with STATIC libraries, (in Visual studio you should always change /MD to /MT for releases and /MDd to /MTd for debug)

1) download ogredeps. http://bitbucket.org/cabalistic/ogredeps

2) edit OIS cmakeLists.txt and add "AND NOT WIN32" inside "if(NOT APPLE AND NOT ANDROID)". 
Make static Visual Studio files with Cmake selecting only OIS, Freetype and Freeimage. Compile and install with VS.

3) Download librocket and make static files for visual studio (disable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS), put path to the same freetype from dependencies. Compile and install.

4) Download Ogre3D source (v2.0 and previous versions works fine) and move dependencies to "Dependencies" folder inside it. Make with the following components: (meshlodgenerator?) RtShader, a rendersystem (GL or Direct3D9) and OctreeSceneManager. install to make sdk.


5) Add env variables: OGRE_SDK, LIBROCKET.

6) make project with cmake and compile in VS.


----------

With dynamic libraries, the Ogre precompiled SDK with dependencies can be used.
